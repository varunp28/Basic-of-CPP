# To Study and Implement C++ Progra Structures
C++ is a powerful programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. To write effective programs, it is important to understand the basic structure and organization of a C++ program.

Basic Components of a C++ Program
Preprocessor Directives
These are instructions given to the compiler before the actual compilation starts. They are typically used to include libraries and header files necessary for the program.

Main Function
The main function serves as the entry point for program execution. Every C++ program must have a main function from where the execution begins.

Variable Declaration and Initialization
Variables are used to store data values in a program. Before using variables, they must be declared with appropriate data types. Initialization assigns an initial value to the variable.

Statements and Expressions
Statements perform operations such as calculations, data assignments, and function calls. Expressions combine variables, constants, and operators to produce new values.

Functions
Functions divide the program into modular blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Besides the main function, user-defined functions help in code reuse and better organization.

Comments
Comments are non-executable lines used to explain the code. They improve code readability and serve as documentation for programmers.
